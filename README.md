# Project 2 - Python 101

The most basic thing you can do with python is to use it as a calculator. Solve these using a python shell

1001 + 110 = 1111
2354 + 300 = 2654
9*2 = 18
(2*5)+5 = 15
2*(3+2) = 10
1 + (1/2) = 1.5
1 - (1/2) = 0.5

type() function lets you know the give python object.
Write the responses from these lines of code for example:
type("Hi") = <type 'str'>


type('hello') = <class 'str'>
type() =
type(2) = <class 'int'>
type(3.14) = <class 'float'>
type([1,2,3]) = <class 'list'>
type([1,2,3][]) =
type([1,2,3][0]) = <class 'int'>
type([1,2,3][1]) = <class 'int'>
type([1,2,3][3]) =
type([1,2,3][4]) =


How do you get out of a python shell? exit()


open input_function.py and fix the errors. Make sure the code executes by running 'python input_function.py'. Once you have it working, copy and paste all the text right after the code is executed.

print("Hello user what is your name?")
usr_name = input()
print("What is your favorite number?")
usr_number = input()
print("Tell me a riddle")
input()
print("That's a cool riddle " + usr_name + "! Thank you for telling me. Here is a box with " + usr_number + " choclates in it ")



Finish the following code
wages = 3000
bills = 200
rent = 600
food = 200
savings = wages - bills - rent - food



give the string city = 'Baltimore' write the code

to print out the 4th character in the string  
  city = "baltimore"
  print (city[3:4])

to print out the last character in the string  print (city[len(city)-1:])

to print out a slice of the first 4 characters in the string  print (city[:4])
